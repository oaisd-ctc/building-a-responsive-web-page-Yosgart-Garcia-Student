            Hello, I'm [YOSGART GARCIA]. I'm an aspiring web developer eager to learn more about web design!<br>
            Here is an image of rice pudding--my favorite dessert--to fill up space. :)<br><br>

            <h2>Some HTML / CSS Projects:</h2>
            <article>
                <h3>Fix My Page</h3>
                <p>
                    The project revolved around a broken page with various faults in the HTML code. We (the students)
                    had to find and resolve errors in the HTML to fix the page.

                <h3>Test Your Skills</h3>
                <p>
                    This project was similar to <em>Fix My Page</em> but contained more code to be fixed.

                <h3>Understanding CSS</h3>
                <p>
                    To better understand CSS, this project required us to implement all forms of CSS code into our HTML,
                    including inline, external, and embedded.<br>
                    In addition to this, the project tested knowledge of relative links since we needed images and a
                    link to our external CSS.

                <h3>Personal Project</h3>
                <p>
                    For our first perfomance test we could make a website about any personal subject we would like to
                    talk about.<br>
                    Although not very personal, I made mine about <em>Dante's Inferno</em> since I was reading it in my
                    integrated class.
                    We had to meet certain requirements for the content in our code for a good score.<br>
                    Varied use of CSS and HTML was needed in addition to personal research of new tags and declarations.
